# C - Pointers, arrays and strings

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming track. It focuses on pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.

## Description

In this project, we explore:
- Pointers and how to use them
- Arrays and how to use them
- Differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables

## Files

* `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
* `0-reset_to_98.c`: Function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
* `1-swap.c`: Function that swaps the values of two integers.
* `2-strlen.c`: Function that returns the length of a string.
* `3-puts.c`: Function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
* `4-print_rev.c`: Function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
* `5-rev_string.c`: Function that reverses a string.
* `6-puts2.c`: Function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.
* `7-puts_half.c`: Function that prints half of a string.
* `8-print_array.c`: Function that prints n elements of an array of integers.
* `9-strcpy.c`: Function that copies the string pointed to by src to the buffer pointed to by dest.

## Requirements

* Programs will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All files should end with a new line
* Code should use the Betty style
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h

## Compilation

To compile the C programs, use:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o <output_name>

## Usage

After compilation, run the program:

./<output_name>
